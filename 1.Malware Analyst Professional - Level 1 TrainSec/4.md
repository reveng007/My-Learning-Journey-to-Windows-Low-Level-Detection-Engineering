# Dissecting FlawedAmmyy (Trognization of AmmyAdmin Remote Admin Tool): Static Analysis

## 1. Opening Sample in Hex Editor:

### Checking IAT in Hex Editor:
> ### We can see what are the probable API which can be used by the malware (all are imported but may happen some are not used.)

<img width="1536" height="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5297228e-af15-4936-9678-40faa14c6852" />

### At the very End, we can see that a pattern is there, `6F` is being repeated and also random chars are present without presence of any spaces (Indicator of obfuscation/Encryption).

### At the very End, we can see Manifest. It won't ask for Administrative Prompt/UAC Prompt.

## 2. String extractions:

<details><summary>See Details</summary>

### 1. Process Names, somehow may be related to `createtoolhelp32snapshot` WinAPI

<img width="1862" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59827535-a938-407f-8704-1668cd3fe676" />

<img width="380" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86715c8e-6d3b-4e11-ac95-0754537688c0" />

### This revelation of Window APIs here also says that API hashing type functions are not present in here. Check [Resources for learning about reversing API hashed binary](https://github.com/reveng007/My-Learning-Journey-to-Windows-Low-Level-Detection-Engineering/blob/main/1.Malware%20Analyst%20Professional%20-%20Level%201%20TrainSec/4.md#resources).

</details>

## 3. PE Parsing via PE Bear:

<details><summary>See Details</summary>

### 1. Rich Header Shows what type of linker and Compiler is used.

<img width="1948" height="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44484d64-a821-45fb-8669-09ece4a6cb92" />

### 2. Checking the Base Address from where the malware starts to execute : Image Base + Entry Point 

<img width="1945" height="1208" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce89bb5-7236-4c49-8f83-49857bc08ed2" />

### 3. Under Section Headers: 2 `.rdata` Sections, which is Odd. On top of that, 1 `.rdata` (read data) has executable permission which is again sus.

<img width="1934" height="1180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88fe09dd-f661-47f4-bac3-19666e12ece8" />

### 4. Under Section Headers: Size of the `.rsrc` (resource) section (raw size as well as the Virtual Size) is relatively bigger than the other sections -> SUS!.

<img width="1940" height="1211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef301fde-03b3-4d4a-adfa-f9511fd266f3" />

#### Raw Size = Size on the File System/Disk 
#### Virtual Size = Size in the Runtime Memory

### 5. Under Imports: We can see different dlls

<img width="1944" height="1174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/105ab3a9-2979-404c-ba42-5e24d8d76669" />

#### This shows that there is probability of this malware to take screenshots (Needs further validation of usage of these APIs)
<img width="1944" height="1174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a83c8a69-05f5-44b2-9793-51409cb4abda" />

> createdcw: https://www.google.com/search?q=createdcw+screenshot&sxsrf=AE3TifOWSeIpzjnqvIelA45fslZXlO5dmA%3A1764451359119

#### 6. Under Imports: Presence of `winspool.drv` (Client-side functions of the Print Spooler)

<img width="1945" height="1176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7fea9c-5d1e-4d84-80cf-964e20247fbe" />

##### It might gives us a suspicion that `spoolsv.exe` - Windows Print Spooler service process may be exploited here. It may be ! but in this case there is no such exploitation. So it depends, presence of `WINSPOOL.DRV` doesn't mean exploitation of _spoolsv.exe_.

## 4. Detecting Malware Packing (if packed):

### 1. Entropy Checking: Detect It Easy

### 2. Loading in Resource Hacker

#### NOTE:
> 1. WannaCry Ransomeware Sample was dropped in Resource Hacker but it was not getting loaded.
> 2. Because Magic byte headers were being messed with.
> 3. <img width="990" height="84" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ecce5d-43f8-4db5-bcce-cba438bb7194" />
> 4. We have to remove the extra bytes before `MZ` Headers.

#### As it is a trojnaized version of AmmyAdmin Remote Admin Tool, we can see GUI of the legitimate software. Malware Author didn't go extra mile to remove the GUI stuff of AmmyAdmin.

### Pattern Recognition via Eye Balling (will need practice to recognise repeating patterns) and then checking within Hex Editor.

<img width="1190" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428304a0-b642-4294-8d24-2c61a9545a30" />

#### Then copy tht byte pattern then search in Hex Editor: We can see that it repeats itself => Meaning somekind of encryption/obfuscation algorithm is being used.

#### We hav also seen `6F` pattern being repeated too in the beginning of this README.md => Strong Indicator of Obfucsation/Encryption algorithm.
