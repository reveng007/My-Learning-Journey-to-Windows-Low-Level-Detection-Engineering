# 1.Exe Vs Dll

## 1. For Exe, only imports are there. But for Dll, both are there.

## 2. But in case of `exe`, exports can also be there in some cases. In that case, we have to check the entry point of the file.

### If `DllEntryPoint` is there, that means `Dll` and if `Start`, `Main` or `WinMain` and other than DllEntryPoint, then it is an exe.

### Btw, MS Excel file has magic byte header same as zip file : `PK`.

## Playing:

### In this case, I have packed the above mentioned zip file (unzipped it - It became folder) and then performed an encrypted zipping of it (Removed zip extension).
> I did it just for expermental purposes!

1. This Says, the file being analysed is a zip/archive (`.xlsx` also has same magic byte) file (`PK` magic byte) (nothing specific, encrypted zip or not)
2. This says, a file named, `HxDSetup.exe` is present under folder named, `HxDSetup`.
3. Another magic byte `PK` is present in 3rd line after `HxDSetUp/` not sure why ????

### When zip (encrypted or not) is present within another zip (encrypted or not)
