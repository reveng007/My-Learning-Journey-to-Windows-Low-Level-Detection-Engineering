## 1. For Exe, only imports are there. But for Dll, both are there.

## 2. But in case of `exe`, exports can also be there in some cases. In that case, we have to check the entry point of the file.

### If `DllEntryPoint` is there, that means `Dll` and if `Start`, `Main` or `WinMain` and other than DllEntryPoint, then it is an exe.
